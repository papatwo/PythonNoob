''' Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a
researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h
if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h
papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5] Output: 3  Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the
researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had               received
3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.               Since the researcher has 3
papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining               two with
no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3. Note: If there are several
possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

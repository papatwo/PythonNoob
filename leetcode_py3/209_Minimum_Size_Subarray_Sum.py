''' 
Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the
minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. If there isn't
one, return 0 instead.

Example:

Input: s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3] Output: 2 Explanation: the subarray [4,3]
has the minimal length under the problem constraint. Follow up: If you have
figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution of which the time
complexity is O(n log n).
